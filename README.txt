TODO:
	- Discover why "Step" Views are not rendered in the "Wizard" views, even though they are loaded into the ContentPresenter and trigger PropertyNotifyChanged events.
	- The "BtnNext" Button needs to be changed to a "CommandBar" allowing navigation between steps.
	- All wizards and steps need to be made abstract.
	- Put wizard "Canvas" into separate view made specifically for rendering steps in the view project.
